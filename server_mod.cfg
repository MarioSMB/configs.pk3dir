// Custom configuration for the SMB servers
// Copy this file to the configs folder before modifying it, to prevent accidental overwrites in the future!

// Please read all comments before changing settings, as not knowing what they can do may break things! (P.S. If you skipped this notice, you deserve to break things)


// Main setup
// Decide here what your server is - default is a placeholder
// NOTE: This should be near the top of the file, so your custom settings aren't overridden!
set _server_type "custom" "Please look in the configs folder to see which common_ configs are available"

// Tourney setup
// If a tourney requires custom server setup, you may specify it here
set _server_tourney "none" "Server tourney options, defaults to none (no tourney). Please look in the configs folder to see which tourney_ configs are available"

// Setup common settings for the selected server type (default is a placeholder)
exec configs/common_${_server_type}.cfg
exec configs/server_${_server_type}.cfg // Useful for multiple server enviroments - loads an extra server config from the configs folder which may contain post-setup options



// Custom server setup
// ADD YOUR SETTINGS BELOW!


// Server options
// Stuff that matters most
sv_public 1 // Indicates whether this server can be seen in the server list (0 will make the server hidden to external lists, -1 to make server completely private)
hostname "(TAG) Competitive Server [${g_xonoticversion}]" // Name for your server in the server list
sv_motd "Welcome to ${hostname} | Owner: nobody | Admins: nobody, nobody | Configs provided by SMB"
sv_adminnick "^1Server^3" // Set this to the name you would like server broadcasts to show from
sv_curl_defaulturl "http://smb.djstrikes3.com/" // This is required for clients to download custom maps, default is to a host containing most known custom maps, change if needed
rcon_secure 0 // By default, rcon_secure is 1, but this is very unstable (requires time to be synced between host and client, which is difficult), change if you want
rcon_password "securepassword" // This password allows anyone to do almost anything to your server, be careful with it!
rcon_restricted_password "notsosecurepassword" // This allows moderators to use advanced actions (like kick, kickban etc)
port 26000 // You may only need to change this if you're using a firewall, or running multiple servers
g_playerstats_uri "http://stats.xonotic.org/stats/submit" // Add this server to the global stats tracking system (stats.xonotic.org), setting to "" will not send stats

// Configs
// List here the execs for any custom configuration files you might use
// Example: exec mystuff.cfg

// Lists
// List here options that serve as lists for easy reference
// NOTE: if you wish to use the optional server extensions and their votes, you will need to add aliases from the Aliases section in configs/optional.cfg to your vote list
// Example: sv_vote_commands "kick gotomap endmatch extendmatchtime reducematchtime restart shuffleteams cointoss nextmap"

// Aliases
// List here any custom aliases
// Example: alias nobots "settemp minplayers 0; bot_number 0; say ^2Bots disabled for this match!"

// Balance
// List here any changes to the weapon balance you might use (prefix any custom settings from the SMB mod with set )
// Example: set g_balance_rifle_weaponreplace "vortex"

// Physics
// List here any changes to the movement/physics you might use
// Example: sv_stepheight 34

// General
// List here any changes to other settings you might use
// Example: set g_buffs 1


// Uncomment this if you wish to use the optional server extensions (vote aliases, known evil troll bans etc)
//exec configs/optional.cfg

// Tourney configs should NOT be modified, as they are provided by the tourney manager
// They are also not overriden by settings in configs/server_mod.cfg
exec configs/tourney_${_server_type}_${_server_tourney}.cfg // Execute per-mode tourney settings
exec configs/tourney_global_${_server_tourney}.cfg // Execute global tourney settings
